# cloud-client-java
littleBits Cloud Platform client library for JVM applications.

## Usage

**TODO**

## Build

Manually building the library is not something we recommend if all you want is to use it.
Be advised, there may be roadblocks ahead! But if you **really, really** want to do it, you must have installed:
* Git
* Maven 3.x
* JDK 8

First step is to clone the code:
```
git clone https://github.com/littlebits/cloud-client-java.git
cd cloud-client-java
```

That taken care of, just open a terminal window and run:
```
mvn clean package
```

You should find the result in the `target` folder.
